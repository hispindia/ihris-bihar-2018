iHRIS, IntraHealth Internationalâ€™s free, open source software, helps countries around the world track and manage their health workforce data to improve access to services. Countries use it to capture and maintain high-quality information for health workforce planning, management, regulation, and training.

iHRIS is built on a flexible framework that allows ministries of health, professional councils, and health service delivery organizations to adapt applications for a wide variety of uses. Developed in collaboration with national stakeholders beginning in 2005, with support from USAID, iHRIS is used in more than 20 countries to manage over a million health worker records at a potential cost savings of over $275 million when compared to commercial software.
